					Coal Critters - by Lynn

==============================================================================================================|

OBJECTIVE:

You are under attack by evil coal critters! 
Luckily, your fire magic sets them aflame 
(except for the ones that so conveniently have a fuse, those instantly explode). 
However, defeated coals might bounce right back at you as fireballs... 
It would be silly to defeat yourself with your own magic, wouldn't it?

Made using the BUas template (from 3DGEP.com) as an intake assignment for the CMGT course, 
with the theme 'bounce'.

CONTROLS:

WASD - to move
SPACEBAR - to dash
MOUSE - to aim
LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - to shoot
F5 - to enable hitboxes
ESC - to pause

UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A - insert the 'konami' code on a menu to access a secret game mode ;)
